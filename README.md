## Me-Me-Inn

### Description

The current tools that help people learn vocabulary suffers from the problem that learners lose interests and motivation as time elapses. Hence we produce a solution to this problem by adding in excitement of competition into the learning process. We propose an online game that employs the idea of ladder ranking; learners can choose to go into a match and they would be matched by a random player with similar levels for a battle. A set number of questions will be tossed out and the two players would race to answer them; their score would be based on their answersâ€™ correctness and speed.

### Motivation

The idea comes from two considerations. One is that people are struggling to memorize horrible amount of words in order to pass the language test. They will need some help to get rid of long tedious practice solely on their own. The other is because when people are joined in a time-limited, competitive event, they can be more focused on the topic and gain more efficiency in finishing the job. So we propose a ladder ranking system for individual learners to join the competition with each other and make bigger progress in vocabulary memorization through the sense of achievement gained in competition.
